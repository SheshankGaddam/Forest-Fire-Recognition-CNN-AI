# Forest-Fire-Recognition-CNN-AI
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python to detect forest fire combustion from images, aiming to protect wildlife and environment.

# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)

This project presents an AI-powered solution to detect and classify forest fires from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to help in early fire detection, environmental protection, and resource optimization for fire management authorities.

## 🧠 Motivation

- Protect forests, wildlife, and tribal communities.
- Enable a user-friendly fire detection system accessible from anywhere.
- Use deep learning to visualize combustion patterns and predict fire outbreaks from static images.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a CNN-based image classifier that can:
- Accurately identify fire vs. non-fire forest images.
- Be deployed through a simple front-end interface.
- Serve as a base for real-time automated forest fire alert systems.
